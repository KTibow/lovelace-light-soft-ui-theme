[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)  
Home Assistant light theme, built on from @JuanMTech, using style boilerplates from @thomasloven and @N-L1.
This theme depends on [`card-mod`](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) for the soft-ui styling.
Looking for the [dark theme instead?](https://github.com/KTibow/lovelace-dark-soft-ui-theme/)
